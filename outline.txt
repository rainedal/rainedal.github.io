MOBILE APPLICATIONS/USER EXPERIENCE 

-- 

I have a fierce adoration for digital experiences that are both clean and functional. I would like to make the internet a delightful place, one website, ad unit, and prototype at a time.

--


* MOBILE TEMPLATES 2.0
> the challenge
>> current set of templates needed a more intuitive experience

> what i did
>> through whiteboarding sessions and rapid prototypes, i worked with senior ux designers to create new designs for templates
>> notable solution: partial pull-down overlay interface that contains secondary feature (video, gallery)

> result
>> (insert high-fidelity storyboard)


* PREVIEWER
> the challenge
>> creating a foundation layout for a creative design previewing tool developed internally

> what i did
>> created rapid prototypes for minimum viable product (mvp)
>>> [Previewer] Rapid Prototypes.pdf <<<


* CONVERSANT CLIENT ACCESS
> the challenge
>> how does managing client user accounts look like for an internally developed client-facing platform?

> what i did
>> feature: managing client user accounts
>> created workflows + wireframes
>> workflows featured: client-side and server-side actions, application displays, user interactions
>> wireframes featured: error handling scenarios

> result
>>> (insert three-four screens from Portfolio - CAP - mod.psd)


* VIDGEO
> the challenge
>> creating the experience + branding message of a mobile application for finding/exploring geotagged videos

> what i did
>> designed branding
>> sketched rapid prototypes 
>> created low-/high-fidelity mocks

> result
>>> (insert logo/s + high-fidelity mocks)


* TRADIITIONS
> the challenge
>> creating the experience + branding message of a mobile application for an achievement platform/system that rewards students for participating in on-campus events

PROTOTYPES

-- 

(elevating the company's product suite by building proof-of-concept prototypes through javascript + integrating this logic into the company's internal framework)

--

* OPENWEATHERMAP
> the challenge
>> Exploring the possibility of utilizing weather information for an added layer of personalized messaging.

> what i did
>> Created a prototype that can be utilized and customized for personalized messaging by leveraging the following parameters:
>>> hyperlocal weather
>>> current conditions (rain, snow)
>>> extreme weather conditions (tornado, blizzard)
>>> hot/cold thresholds

> result
>>> (add threshold + condition gifs)


* INSTAGRAM API
> the challenge
>> wanted to explore the possibility of pulling in social media feeds into an ad unit through the social media API

> what i did
>> created a prototype using a combination of html, javascript, and the internal javascript-based framework to create a plausible solution
>> pulled in information through API when given
>>> a hashtag
>>> a user handle
>>> a location

> result
>>> (add prototype screenshot + wireframe on-hover)


* SPRITESHEET ANIMATION
> the challenge
>> Exploring the possibility of utilizing spritesheets for improved animation and additional ad unit functionality, like:
>>> 360 product viewers
>>> Video sequences that can react through user interaction (touch, accelerometer)

> what i did
>> Created a game prototype that utilized a spritesheet video sequence
>> Spritesheet would advance or go back based on user interaction

> result
>>> (video)
